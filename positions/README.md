This directory contains some initial Sonic Pi scripts focused on practicing various cello positions. As a beginner cellist, I'm using these scripts to aid my own practice and share what I've come up with so far. The exercises are simple and intended to help with familiarizing yourself with different positions on the cello. As I develop my skills and understanding, I hope to refine and add more complex and diverse exercises. Your feedback and contributions are welcome as this project evolves!
