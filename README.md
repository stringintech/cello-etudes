Welcome to the cello-etudes repository! This is a personal project where I'm combining my passion for programming with my journey as a beginner cellist. Here, you'll find a collection of Sonic Pi scripts and music sheets that I've created or generated to help with cello practice. Since I'm still learning the cello, these scripts are quite basic, but as I continue to improve, I plan to enhance and expand the content in this repository. Feel free to explore, experiment, and contribute as I work on growing this project!
